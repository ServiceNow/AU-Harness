# üìä Task Overview

## üìù Summary

This framework supports structured **evaluation runs** across a range of **Task Categories** and **Task Names**. Each valid combination corresponds to an accepted configuration in your `config.yaml` file. For clarity, each task lists its associated **Supported Metrics**, which are automatically handled by the evaluation pipeline.

Use this documentation to configure and understand supported evaluation targets and their corresponding metrics.

For more detailed documentation regarding individual metrics, refer to [Metrics Overview](../metrics/README.md).

## üßæ Task Category Descriptions

| Task Category                     | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **üó£Ô∏è speech_recognition**         | Tasks involving automatic speech recognition (ASR), including standard ASR, long-form ASR, and code-switching ASR. |
| **üé≠ paralinguistics**            | Tasks that analyze non-verbal aspects of speech such as emotion, gender, accent, and speaker characteristics. |
| **üîä audio_understanding** | Tasks that require understanding of the general audio signals including but not limited to music, noise, sound. |
| **üß† spoken_language_understanding** | Tasks that require understanding of spoken language and/or audio information including QA, translation, summarization, and intent classification. |
| **üß© spoken_language_reasoning**  | Tasks that require reasoning over spoken input, such as instruction following or logical/mathematical reasoning. |
| **üîê safety_and_security**        | Tasks related to assessing model behavior around safety, robustness, and vulnerability to spoofing or adversarial content. |
