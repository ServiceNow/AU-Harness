# üó£Ô∏è Speech Recognition
Speech Recognition refers to the task category involving the process of converting spoken language into into a machine-readable text format. This task category serves as the critical step for machines to understand and process humans' speech.

## Sample Config
```yaml
dataset_metric:
  # All datasets within **SPEECH RECOGNITION** task category (including: asr + code_switching_asr + long_form_asr)
  - ['speech_recognition', 'word_error_rate']
  
  # All datasets within **long_form_asr** sub-task category
  - ['long_form_asr', 'word_error_rate']

  # Individual dataset
  - ["librispeech_test_clean", "word_error_rate"]
```
