# ðŸ§© Spoken Language Reasoning
Spoken Language Reasoning refers to the task category involving performing complex, logical operations on information conveyed through speech. These tasks go beyond simple transcription or understanding a single utterance, as they require the model to comprehend context, make inferences, user external tools, folow complex multi-step instructions and answer questions that demand a deeper understanding of the spoken content.

## Sample Config
```yaml
dataset_metric:
  
  # All datasets within **scene_understanding** sub-task category
  - ['mtbench', 'mt_bench_llm_judge']

  # Individual dataset
  - ["mtbench_audio", "mt_bench_llm_judge"]
```
