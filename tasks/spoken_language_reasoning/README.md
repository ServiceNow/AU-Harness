# ðŸ§© Spoken Language Reasoning
Spoken Language Reasoning refers to the task category involving performing complex, logical operations on information conveyed through speech. These tasks go beyond simple transcription or understanding a single utterance, as they require the model to comprehend context, make inferences, user external tools, folow complex multi-step instructions and answer questions that demand a deeper understanding of the spoken content.

## Sample Config
```yaml
dataset_metric:
  
  # All datasets within **scene_understanding** sub-task category
  - ['mtbench', 'mt_bench_llm_judge']

  # Individual dataset
  - ["mtbench_audio", "mt_bench_llm_judge"]
```
## SPEECH_TO_SQL
Before running evaluations for **SPEECH_TO_SQL** task, it is required to follow the installation steps using the script in [`data/scripts/download_spider.sh`](../../data/scripts/download_spider.sh). The `data/spider/` directory and its subsidiary files would be created if the installation completes successfully. Failure to install these will result in the inability to run evaluations of 
  - `[spider_audio, sql_score]`
  - `[spider_text, sql_score]`

 More specifically, execute the below before running the evaluation for `speech_to_sql`.

```bash
cd AU-Harness/
bash data/scripts/downnload_spider.sh
```
