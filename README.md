# 🎧 Large Audio Language Model (LALM) Toolkit

The **LALM Toolkit** is a lightweight, modular framework for running inference and evaluation on large audio language models. 
Designed for speed, flexibility, and ease of integration, it allows developers and researchers to evaluate spoken language understanding directly from audio inputs using modern language models.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔊 **Audio-to-Text Inference** using pre-trained large language models
- ⚡ **High-throughput** batch inference with async support
- 🧪 **Evaluation-ready** interface with support for standard metrics (e.g. WER, BLEU and custom Judge Models)
- 🧩 Easy to plug in your own models

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- Evaluate speech comprehension in long-form audio
- Benchmark LLMs on spoken prompts and instructions
- Integrate structured audio-text inference into pipelines
- Prototype multimodal agents that reason over speech
