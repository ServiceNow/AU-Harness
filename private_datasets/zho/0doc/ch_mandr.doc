1.  Summary abstract

        The CallHome Mandarin corpus of telephone speech was collected
and transcribed by the Linguistic Data Consortium primarily in support
of the project on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition
(LVCSR), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense.

        This release of the CallHome Mandarin corpus consists of 120
unscripted telephone conversations between native speakers of
Mandarin.  The transcripts cover a contiguous 5 or 10 minute segment
(see section 2 below) taken from a recorded conversation lasting up to
30 minutes.  All speakers were aware that they were being recorded.
They were given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about.
Once a caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free
choice of whom to call.  Most participants called family members or
close friends overseas.  All calls originated in North America.  The
distribution of call destinations can be found in the file
"ma_spkrs.tbl".

        The transcripts are timestamped by speaker turn for alignment
with the speech signal, and are provided in standard orthography.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Data acquisition

        Speakers were solicited by the LDC to participate in this
telephone speech collection effort through personal contacts and
appeals to organizations.  A total of 200 call originators were found,
each of whom placed a telephone call via a toll-free robot operator
maintained originally by Rutgers University, and later by the LDC.
Access to the robot operator was possible via a unique Personal
Identification Number (PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at Rutgers
or the LDC when the caller enrolled in the project.  The participants
were made aware that their telephone call would be recorded, as were
the call recipients.  The call was allowed only if both parties agreed
to being recorded.  Each caller was allowed to talk up to 30 minutes.
Each caller was allowed to place only one telephone call.

        In all, 200 calls were transcribed.  Of these, 80 have been
designated as training calls, 20 as development test calls, and 100 as
evaluation test calls.  For each of the training and development test
calls, a contiguous 10-minute region was selected for transcription;
for the evaluation test calls, a 5-minute region was transcribed.  For
the present publication, only 20 of the evaluation test calls are
being released; the remaining 60 test calls are being held in reserve
for future LVCSR benchmark tests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Data verification

        After a successful call was completed, a human audit of each
telephone call was conducted to verify that the proper language was
spoken, to check the quality of the recording, and to select and
describe the region to be transcribed.  The description of the
transcribed region provides information about channel quality, number
of speakers, their gender, and other attributes.  The information from
this audit may be found in the file "ma_calls.tbl", and its contents
are described in greater detail in "ma_calls.doc".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Speaker demographics

        Information on speaker demographics can be found in the file
ma_spkrs.tbl, whose contents are described in the file ma_spkrs.doc.

5.  Data transcription - General

        The initial transcription was carried out by Texas
Instruments; segmentation and corrections were done at the LDC.  Below
are the general transcription instructions given to transcribers by
TI:


     CALLHOME TRANSCRIPTION CONVENTIONS - General (TI)


1.  Transcribe "verbatim", without correcting grammatical errors.

2.  Do not try to imitate pronunciation details, including accents and
    mispronunciations.  Write the words that you believe the speaker
    intended, using standard orthography.

3.  Speaker identification:

    Label each speaker with A: or B: at the beginning of the line.

    Use A: for the lower speaker and B: for the upper speaker in the waveform.
    (A will be the person calling from the U.S., and B the person overseas.)

    If there is more than one speaker at one end of the conversation (e.g.
    the telephone is passed around, or multiple extensions in use), add
    numbers for each new speaker:

        B:  (the first speaker on side B)
        B1: (a different speaker)
        B2: (yet another speaker)

    Try to label the speakers consistently.  For example, if the first
    speaker returns, use "B:" again.

4.  Speaker turns:

    Begin each speaker turn on a new line.  Do not put carriage returns
    within a speaker line.  (Don't worry if the screen shows a break in the
    middle of a word.)

    Each speaker turn begins and ends with a pause.  That is, each continuous
    stretch of speech is transcribed as one turn.  Any simultaneous speech
    on the other channel is transcribed separately, after the current turn
    is completed.

    Example: (x indicates speech, - indicates silence)

    channel B:     xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx---------xxxxxxxxx--
    channel A:     -------xxx-----xxx-----xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx--------
    time           0      1       2       3      4      5

    sequence of turns in the transcription (times are not exact):
    0.1 3.1 B:
    1.0 1.3 A:
    2.0 2.3 A:
    3.0 5.0 A:
    4.6 5.9 B:

    A "turn" consisting entirely of noise is transcribed only if it is
    a vocal tract noise from the talker (laugh, cough, etc.) - see 7 below.
    Channel noise is NOT transcribed.


5.  Simultaneous speech on the same channel:

    If two people are speaking on the same channel (an extension phone or
    a speaker phone), and if they speak simultaneously, put pound signs #
    around the words spoken simultaneously.

    Example:

        B:  #Oh, how interesting.#
        B1: #That's good news.#

    If only part of the utterance is simultaneous, mark only the part that
    is simultaneous, but transcribe the entire utterance as one turn.
    Put the other speaker's utterance on the next line, with its times.

    Example:

    10.5 12.5 B:  Well, I agree with you.  #I think# you're right.
    11.5 12.0 B1: #Oh yes, yes.#

    Note that # is used only for simultaneous speech on the same channel.
    Simultaneous speech on different channels is identifiable as such by
    reference to the time marks.

6.  Partial words:

    If a speaker does not finish a word, write as much as you heard
    and end it with a hyphen.  Put a space after the hyphen, but no space
    before it.

7.  Non-speech sounds:

    a)  Sounds made by the talker:

    When the participants in the conversation make sounds that are not
    speech, indicate them using a label between braces, for example:

        {cough}
        {laugh}

    Example:

        A:  Oh, that's funny. {laugh} {cough} Excuse me, I have a cold.

    If the talker makes one of these sounds as an entire turn, transcribe
    it and show the times, for example:

        340.0 342.0 A: {laugh}

    b)  Other sounds:

    Mark other sounds using brackets [ ].  This includes background
    noises, background speech, and noises on the line.  Mark these sounds
    only when they are clearly audible and about as loud as the speech.
    If they are hard to hear, or quieter than the speech, then ignore them.

    Also, do not transcribe noises that occur when no one on that channel
    is speaking, even if the noises are loud and clear.  For example, if
    B is speaking and there is a loud noise on channel A (which is not made
    by speaker A), do not transcribe it.

    Examples:

    A clearly audible noise occurs during speech:

        A:  Yes [noise].

    If the event being described lasts longer than a few words, then
    indicate the beginning in braces [ ], and the end in braces with a
    "/", [/ ].  For intermittent sounds, mark the beginning and end of the
    intermittent occurrence of the sound - not the beginning and end of
    each individual occurrence.

    Example:

        A:  Well, it all depends, uh, on, you know, [baby_crying] how the
        family reacts.  I mean, it can be a positive or a negative thing,
        you know?
        B:  Yes, you're right.
        A:  So it's difficult to say what's best sometimes. [/baby_crying]

    Note: Be sure to mark the end on the channel where it occurred (A, in
    the example above).  If the noise ends while the other speaker is
    talking, mark it at the end of the turn of the speaker on the same
    channel.  For example, if the baby stops crying while B is talking:

        A:  Well, it all depends, uh, on, you know, [baby_crying] how the
        family reacts.  I mean, it can be a positive or a negative thing,
        you know? [/baby_crying]
        B:  Yes, you're right.
        A:  So it's difficult to say what's best sometimes.

8.  Speech to someone in the background:

    If the speaker talks to someone in the background, put the speech between
    double slash marks.

    Examples:

        A: Just a minute.  // Mary, please bring me a pencil. //

        A: Sm //una llamada de// ?quieres hablar un poquito con tu papa?

9.  When a word or phrase is not clear, type double parentheses ((  ))
    around what you think you hear.  If there is no way to tell what the
    speaker said, leave one blank space between the double parentheses,
    indicating speech has been left out because it was unintelligible.

    Examples:

        A:  So when I finally did ((take up)) the violin, I
        progressed pretty quickly in the beginning.

        B:  Of course, that was in college which was a long time
        ago, so (( )) I remember.

10.  Comments

    To put a comment in the transcription, use double square brackets:
    [[comment]]

    Comments should be used very sparingly - only when there is no other
    way to indicate some unusual event.  Notations describing noises should
    use single brackets, not double brackets (see #7).

    Examples of comments:

    [[speaker is singing]]
    [[speaker imitates a little child]]
    [[previous word is exceptionally prolonged]]

    Comments may be used to indicate the reason for unintelligible speech.
    Example:

        (( )) [[distortion]]

    However, use such comments sparingly.  If there is consistent distortion,
    note it on the conversation summary sheet and do NOT put it in the
    transcription every time.  The same is true for mumbling, rapid speech,
    etc.  In other words, use comments only for unusual cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.  Data transcription - Mandarin-specific

1.  Punctuation:

    Use the ASCII (English) punctuation marks rather than Mandarin (to
    save input time).

    Try to use normal Mandarin punctuation, as far as possible, particularly
    period, comma, and question mark.  Because conversational speech does
    not exactly fit punctuation conventions, it may often be difficult to
    decide on the correct punctuation.  In such cases, simply use whatever
    seems reasonable and go on -- do not spend a lot of time analyzing
    it and trying to find the correct way (there may not be one!).

    When the end of a turn is incomplete, leave it unmarked.  That is,
    do not put a period at the end if the utterance stopped without
    completing the clause.

2.  Different languages and/or dialects:

    When talkers use words in a different language or Chinese dialect, or
    when they change languages for a short time, the speech that is
    not Mandarin needs to be marked and the language labeled, if possible.

    a)  Transcribe English in ASCII.  No special marking is required.
    b)  Put angled brackets < > around speech that is not Mandarin or English.
    c)  Put the language name right after the left bracket.  If you don't
        recognize the language, put ?.
    d)  If you can transcribe the speech, put the transcription after the
        language name.  If you can't transcribe it, mark it as
        unintelligible: (( ))

3.  "Mandarinized" foreign names

    Foreign names that are pronounced as in Mandarin should be
    transcribed using whichever characters seem most appropriate (as
    would normally be done in writing Chinese.)  However, if the name is
    not customarily used in Mandarin, and therefore has no standard
    representation, mark it by putting the character + immediately
    before and after it.

4.  Hesitation sounds

    Follow normal Mandarin conventions in representing hesitation sounds;
    mark them with a preceding "%".

6.1.  Mandarin transcription symbol table


    {text}              sound made by the talker

                        {laugh} {cough} {sneeze} {breath}

    [text]              sound not made by the talker (background or channel)

                        [distortion]    [background noise]      [buzz]

    [/text]             end of continuous or intermittent sound not made by
                        the talker (beginning marked with previous [text])

    [[text]]            comment; most often used to describe unusual
                        characteristics of immediately preceding or following
                        speech (as opposed to separate noise event)

                        [[previous word lengthened]]    [[speaker is singing]]

    ((text))            unintelligible; text is best guess at transcription

                        ((coffee klatch))

    (( ))               unintelligible; can't even guess text

                        (( ))


    <language_text>     speech in another language; note that all words
			in angled brackets are separated with "_" (this is
			inserted by the automatic segmenter).

                        <English_going_to_California>

    <? (( ))>           ? indicates unrecognized language; (( )) indicates
                        untranscribable speech

                        <? ayo_canoli>  <? (( ))>

			absolu-

    #text#              simultaneous speech on the same channel
                        (simultaneous speech on different channels is not
                        explicitly marked, but is identifiable as such by
                        reference to time marks)

    //text//            aside (talker addressing someone in background)

                        //quit it, I'm talking to your sister!//

    +text+              Mandarinized foreign name, no standard spelling

    **text**            idiosyncratic word, not in common use, not necessarily
			included in lexicon

                        **poodle-ish**

    *text*		A single asterisk is inserted by the automatic
			segmenter when the word can't be located in the
			LDC Callhome Mandarin lexicon; this symbol should
			be absent from the transcripts.

    %text               This symbol flags non-lexemes, which are
                        general hesitation sounds.  

                        %mm %uh

    &text               used to mark proper names and place names

                        &Mary &Jones    &Arizona        &Harper's
                        &Fiat           &Joe's &Grill


    text --             marks end of interrupted turn and continuation
    -- text             of same turn after interruption, e.g.

                        A: I saw &Joe yesterday coming out of --

                        B: You saw &Joe?!

                        A: -- the music store on &Seventeenth and &Chestnut.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7.  Word segmentation.

Word segmentation principles for Mandarin were formulated by Shudong
Huang at the Linguistic Data Consortium, with input from Xuejun Bian
and Cynthia McLemore, and in subsequent collaboration with LVCSR
Callhome contractors and other interested parties (especially Dragon,
BBN, IBM, TI, NIST, and Bell Labs).  A primary source of information
on Chinese segmentation issues was the following:

"Contemporary Chinese Language Word Segmentation Specification for
Information Processing," published by the State Bureau of Technology
Supervision, Beijing China, October 14, 1992.

Principles guiding word segmentation can be found in the file
"segmentation.principles".

The Callhome Mandarin transcripts were automatically segmented with
the Dragon Mandarin segmenter, which uses the LDC principles as stated
in the "segmentation.principles" file.  Further information on the
Dragon segmenter, provided by Dean Bandes at Dragon Systems Inc.,
follows:

The Dragon Mandarin Segmenter attempts to break a string of Chinese
characters (in the GB encoding) into the most likely sequence of words
in its lexicon and unknown words.  Characters which do not fit into
known words are output as unknown single-character words.  In general,
longer words are preferred, but not at the expense of introducing new
unknown single-character words.  An analogy is the case of a sign
maker who has a stock of strings of letters with a cost associated to
each string, who wants to produce a given sign for the minimum cost.
The cost of each string is based on its frequency (supply and
demand!), and the cost of the entire sign is the sum of the cost of
the strings plus a relatively large cost per string (labor to put them
together).  All letters are available individually, but to save on
labor cost the sign maker will choose not to use them if the sign can
be made of existing combinations of letters.  Simply proceeding from
the beginning of the sign and choosing the longest available string
may not produce the least expensive sign, as one may overshoot a
preferable string; for instance, if the desired sign were "No Parking"
and the stock of strings were "No ", "Park", "Par", "king", "i", "n",
and "g", always choosing the longest would give "No " + "Park" + "i" +
"n" + "g", which would be more expensive than "No " + "Par" + "king".
Simply starting at the end and working backwards always choosing the
longest word won't work any better.

The low-cost segmentation is either a single lexicon entry or the
combination of the lowest-cost segmentations of two substrings, and
thus could in principle be found recursively, trying segmentations of
substrings at each break point; but this would require a lot of
duplicated effort.  The problem may be solved much more efficiently by
standard dynamic programming methods, and that's what the Dragon
Segmenter does. Basically, it remembers the lowest-cost way to segment
text up to each character in turn, looking ahead for matches and
noting the cost to the end of each matching string if it is a new
low-cost way to that character.

The input lexicon must have the format

<count> <word in GB> [<pinyin>] --

that is, the pinyin is optional but the count (frequency) is required;
and the word with the largest count must be first.
