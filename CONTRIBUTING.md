# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to HEAR-Kit!  
We welcome contributions of all kinds ‚Äî new metrics, dataset and task integrations, bug fixes, documentation improvements, and more.  

Please follow the guidelines below to keep the project consistent and easy to maintain.

---

## Branch Naming

All branches must follow the pattern:
<type>/<short-description>

### Allowed `<type>` prefixes
- `feat` ‚Äì new feature (e.g., new metric, task, dataset, evaluator)
- `fix` ‚Äì bug fix
- `docs` ‚Äì documentation changes
- `test` ‚Äì tests or fixtures
- `refactor` ‚Äì refactor code without changing behavior
- `perf` ‚Äì performance improvements
- `ci` ‚Äì CI/CD or automation changes
- `build` ‚Äì build system or dependencies
- `style` ‚Äì formatting/naming only (no logic change)
- `chore` ‚Äì maintenance tasks
- `revert` ‚Äì revert a commit

Special:
- `release/` ‚Äì release preparation (e.g., `release/v0.1.0`)
- `hotfix/` ‚Äì urgent fixes

### Short description rules
- Use **kebab-case**: `fix/audio-loader-bug` ‚úÖ, `fix/AudioLoaderBug` ‚ùå
- Keep it concise (‚â§ 5 words) and descriptive of the change
- Do **not** include usernames, spaces, or special characters

### Examples
- `feat/metric-wer-support`
- `fix/dataloader-stereo-mismatch`
- `docs/benchmarking-guide`
- `test/asr-librispeech-suite`
- `release/v0.1.0`

## Pull Request Workflow

We use the **fork ‚Üí branch ‚Üí PR** model for contributions.  
If you are an external contributor, please work from your fork.  
If you are a maintainer with write access, you may create branches directly on this repository (see Maintainer Notes below).

### üöÄ TL;DR for First-Time Contributors
1. Fork the repo and clone your fork  
2. Create a branch ‚Üí make changes ‚Üí commit  
3. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request to `upstream:main`  

---

### Steps for Contributors

1. **Sync your fork with upstream**:  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main

   Replace upstream with the remote name pointing to the original repository.

2. **Create a branch following the naming rules**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
   ```
   Examples:
   - fix/typo-docs
   - feat/add-audio-eval

3. **Commit changes with clear messages**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "fix: correct typo in README"
    ```

4. **Push your branch to your fork**:
    ```bash
    git push origin <type>/<short-description>
    ```

5. **Create a pull request**:
    - Go to your fork on GitHub and click "New Pull Request"
    - Compare your branch against upstream:main
    - Fill in the PR template with context, motivation, and test details
    - Mark it as a Draft PR if the work is still in progress  
   
6. **Keep your PR up to date**:
    - Rebase frequently on top of upstream/main:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```
    - Resolve conflicts before pushing updates to your branch

7. **Address review feedback promptly**:
    - Use additional commits or amend history if requested
    - Keep the PR focused on a single logical change

### Maintainer Notes

- Maintainers with write access may create branches directly on this repo if:
    - The work needs CI secrets or protected environments
    - The change requires close collaboration among multiple maintainers

- Always clean up merged branches to keep the branch list tidy
- Branch protections and required reviews must be respected
