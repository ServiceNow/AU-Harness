MILLION TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS ANNUALLY FROM THIS UNIT SCHERER 4'S RETIREMENT IS THE FINAL STEP OF THE COAL PHASE OUT STRATEGY THAT FPL LAUNCHED IN 2015 AND THAT WILL COMPLETE THE COMPLO- CLO-CLOSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 2700 MEGAWATTS OF COAL CAPACITY INCLUDING THE HIGHEST GREENHOUSE EMITTING GAS POWER POWER PLANTS IN FLORIDA THESE TRANSACTIONS WHICH WILL MAKE FPL ONE OF THE FIRST UTILITIES TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THE COAL FROM ITS GENERATION PORTFOLIO DEMONSTRATE FPL'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT AND POSITION AS A CLEAN ENERGY LEADER WE REMAIN PROUD OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL TRACK RECORD PARTICULAR THE C02 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED THROUGHOUT FLORIDA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY ERA THAT IS BOTH CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE GULF POWER ALSO HAD A STRONG QUARTER OF EXECUTION THE FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL COST EFFECTIVENESS AT GULF CONTINUES TO PROGRESS WELL WITH YEAR TO DAY O&M COSTS EXCLUDING SPECIFIC COVID-19 RELATED EXPENSES THAT DECLINING BY NEARLY 10% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD AND BY APPROXIMATELY 25% RELATIVE TO 201 GULF POWER ALSO DELIVERED FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN SERVICE RELIABILITY AND CONTINUES ITS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN EMPLOYEE SAFELY SAFETY WITH NO OSHA RECORDABLES YEAR TO DATE TO THE END OF JUNE WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO DELIVERING ON THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE'VE PREVIOUSLY OUTLINED AT GULF POWER AND CONTINUE TO EXPECT TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE OVER THE COMING YEARS DURING THE QUARTER WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL STORM DRILLS FOR FPL AND GULF POWER TO PREPARE FOR THE UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION OF RESTORING POWER AFTER A HURRICANE IN THE MIDST OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WE SPENT TWO WEEKS DRILLING AND CHALLENGING OUR TEAMS TO FIND WAYS TO EFFICIENTLY RESTORE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITHOUT SACRIFICING SAFETY THE DRILLS PROVIDED A NUMBER OF LESSONS INCLUDING HOW TO LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY TO QUICKLY AND SAFELY SCREEN PERSONNEL AT VARIOUS STAGING SITES TO HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WILL INEVITABLY OCCUR WHEN PERFORMING STORM RESTORATION IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC WHILE WE HOPE THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES WILL AVOID THE

THEY NEED US MOST AT ENERGY RESOURCES ADJUSTED EPS INCREASED BY 13 CENTS YEAR OVER YEAR THE ENERGY RESOURCES TEAM CONTINUE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE TERRIFIC MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW COST RENEWABLES ADDING 1730 MEGAWATTS TO OUR BACKLOG SINCE THE LAST EARNINGS CALL THIS CONTINUED ORIGINATION SUCCESS THROUGH THE ONGOING PANDEMIC IS A TEST- TESTAMENT TO THE ENERGY RESOURCES SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES INCLUDING OUR BEST IN CLASS RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT SKILLS OUR ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION TEAM ALSO CONTINUES TO EXECUTE COMMISSIONING ROUGHLY 650 MEGAWATTS DURING THE QUARTER AND KEEPING THE REMAINING APPROXIMATELY 4400 MEGAWATTS OF WIND AND SOLAR PROJECTS THAT WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THIS YEAR ON TRACK DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES THAT ARE OCCURRING BOTH GLOBALLY AND LOCALLY WHILE WE ARE MONITORING THE SITUATION CLOSELY WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT ALL OF OUR PLANNED 2020 RENEWABLES PROJECTS WILL ACHIEVE THEIR IN SERVICE DATES THIS YEAR IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED INVESTOR FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES OR ESG NEXT WEEK WE EXPECT TO PUBLISH NEXTERA ENERGY'S UPDATED ESG REPORT WHICH INCLUDES REPORTING UNDER THE SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD OR SASB DISCLOSURES OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF ESG FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS NEXTERA ENERGY'S APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE AND RISK OVERSIGHT COMBINED WITH THE WAY THAT WE TREAT OUR PEOPLE OUR CUSTOMERS OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE PROOF THAT A COMPANY CAN BE BOTH SUSTAINABLE AND FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL AT THE SAME TIME THE NEW REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THIS ALIGNMENT OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY WITH THE KEY TENANTS OF ESG INCLUDES A ROBUST DISCUSSION OF RISK OVERSIGHT AND INCORPORATES NEW DISCLOSURES SUCH AS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION METRICS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION MATTER DEEPLY TO US AS A COMPANY BOTH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY'RE THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT ALSO BECAUSE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE TEAMS DELIVER BETTER BUSINESS RESULTS FOR THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE OUR COMMITMENT TO HAVING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND INCLUSIVE CULTURE IS NOT NEW AND OUR DIVERSITY METRICS ARE BETTER THAN MANY OF THE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY HOWEVER CONSISTENT WITH OUR FOCUS ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WE ARE NOT SATISFIED AND WILL CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD AN EVEN MORE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE TEAM GOING FORWARD OVERALL WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN NEXTERA ENERGY SO FAR IN 202 AS WE'VE ENTERED THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO ACHIEVE THE FULL YEAR EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED EVEN WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR A REASONABLE RANGE OF IMPACTS AND OUTCOMES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE CURRENT PANDEMIC NOW LETS TURN TO THE DETAILED RESULTS BEGINNING WITH FPL FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 FPL REPORTED A NET INCOME OF $749 MILLION OR A $1.52 PER SHARE WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $86 MILLION AND 15 CENTS PER SHARE RESPECTIVELY YEAR OVER YEAR REGULATORY CAPITAL EMPLOYED INCREASED BY MORE THAT 10% OVER THE SAME QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AND WAS A PRINCIPLE DRIVER OF FPL'S NET INCOME GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 13% FPL'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.80 BILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND WE NOW EXPECT OUR FULL YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO TOTAL BETWEEN $6.50 BILLION AND $6.70 BILLION OUR REPORTED ROE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 11.60% FOR THE 12 MONTH ENDED JUNE 2020 WHICH IS AT THE UPPER END OF THE ALLOWED BAND OF 9.60% TO 11.6% ALLOWED UNDER OUR CURRENT RATE AGREEMENT DURING THE QUARTER WE UTILIZED $7 MILLION OF RESERVE AMORTIZATION TO ACHIEVE OUR TARGET REGULATORY ROE LEAVING FPL WITH A BALANCE OF $736 MILLION WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT FPL WILL END 2020 WITH A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF SURPLUS TO CONTINUE OPERATING UNDER THE CURRENT BASE RATE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DURING 202 AS WE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WE EXPECT THAT FPL AND GULF WILL OPERATE AS A SINGLE LARGER FLORIDA UTILITY COMPANY WHICH WILL CREATE BOTH OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AS RESULT IN MAY THE COMPANY HAS FILED AN APPLICATION WITH FERC FOR AN APPROVAL OF AN INTERNAL REORGANIZATION WHEREBY GULF WOULD MERGE INTO FPL SUBJECT TO FERC APPROVAL THE COMPANIES WILL MERGE IN JANUARY OF 202 HOWEVER DURING 2021 GULF POWER WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS A SEPARATE OPERATING DIVISION SERVING ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS UNDER SEPARATE RETAIL RATES WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE COMPANIES TO FILE A COMBINED RATE CASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR FOR NEW RATES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 202 TURNING TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ALL OF OUR MAJOR CAPITAL INITIATIVES AT FPL REMAIN ON TRACK AND ON BUDGET DURING THE QUARTER THE FINAL 300 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR BEING BUILT UNDER THE SOLAR BASE RATE ADJUSTMENT OR SOBRA MECHANISM AS FPL'S BASE RATE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WERE PLACED INTO SERVICE THE 1200 MEGAWATTS OF COST EFFECTIVE SOLAR CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE SOBRA MECHANISM ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER BENEFITS AND REPRESENT THE EARLY STAGES OF FPL'S RAPID SOLAR EXPANSION AND THE NEXT PHASE OF ITS GENERATION MODERNIZATION EFFORTS THE NEXT SIX SOLAR TOGETHER PROJECTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 450 MEGAWATTS REMAIN ON TRACK TO BE PLACED IN SERVICE LATER THIS YEAR THE FINAL 600 MEGAWATTS OF THE ROUGHLY 1500 MEGAWATT COMMUNITY SOLAR PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO BE PLACED IN SERVICE NEXT YEAR BEYOND SOLAR CONSTRUCTION ON THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT ROUGHLY 1200 MEGAWATT DANIA BEACH CLEAN ENERGY CENTER REMAINS ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET AS IT CONTINUES TO ADVANCE TOWARDS ITS PROJECTED COMMERCIAL OPERATION DATE IN 202 ADDITIONALLY THE 409 MEGAWATT MANATEE STORAGE FACILITY WILL TO BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST BATTERY STORAGE PLANTS IS ON TRACK AND ON BUDGET TO BE COMPLETE NEXT YEAR BASED ON OUR ONGOING ANALYSIS OF THE LONG TERM POTENTIAL OF LOW COST RENEWABLES WE REMAIN CONFIDENT AS EVER THAT WIND SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE WOULD BE USUALLY DISRUPTIVE TO THE ENERGIES EXISTING THE COUNTRIES EXISTING GENERATION <INAUDIBLE> WHILE REDUCING COST FOR CUSTOMERS AND HELPING TO ACHIEVE FUTURE C02 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS HOWEVER TO ACHIEVE AN EMISSIONS FREE FUTURE WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE NECESSARY AND WE ARE PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THE LONG TERM POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN CONSISTENT WITH THE TOE IN THE WATER APPROACH WE'VE PREVIOUSLY UTILIZED WITH SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE WE ARE PLANNING TO PROPOSE A HYDROGEN PILOT PROJECT AT FPL THIS APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION PILOT PROJECT WHICH SUBJECT TO FLO- FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVAL IS EXPECTED TO BE IN SERVICE IN 2023 WILL UTILIZE SOLAR ENERGY THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN CLIPPED TO PRODUCE A 100% GREEN HYDROGEN THROUGH A ROUGHLY 20 MEGAWATT ELECTROLYSIS SYSTEM THE HYDROGEN WILL BE USED TO REPLACE A PORTION OF THE NATURAL GAS THAT IS CONSUMED BY ONE OF THE THREE GAS TURBINES AT THE OKEECHOBEE CLEAN ENERGY CENTER.WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROJECT IS A COMPLIMENT TO OUR ONGOING SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND HIGHLIGHTS FPL'S CONTINUED INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY OF THE CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE FOR ITS CUSTOMERS WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OTHER POTENTIAL HYDROGEN OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND WHILE OUR NEAR TERM INVESTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SMALL IN CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL CAPITAL PROGRAM WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES LONG TERM POTENTIAL WHICH SHOULD FURTHER SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND FOR LOW COST RENEWABLES AS WELL ACCEL- AS ACCELERATE THE DECARBONIZATION OF TRANSPORTATION FUEL AND INDUSTRIAL FEEDSTOCKS.WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT FPL'S ONGOING SMART INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WILL SUPPORT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL EMPLOYED OF APPROXIMATELY 9% FROM 2018 THROUGH 2022 WHILE FURTHER ENHANCING OUR BEST IN CLASS CUSTOMER VALUE PROPOSITION LET ME NOW TURN TO GULF POWER WHICH REPORTED SECOND QUARTER 2020 GAP EARNINGS OF $55 MILLION OR 11 CENTS PER SHARE A DECLINE OF 1 CENT PER SHARE RELATIVE TO GULF POWERS ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD THIS QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ROUGHLY $5 MILLION OF AFTER TAX COVID-19 RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE EXPECTED INCREMENTAL BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC EARLIER THIS MONTH THE FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVED GULF POWERS REQUEST TO RECORD COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO COVID-19 INCLUDING BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS A REGULATORY ASSET ON ITS BALANCE SHEET.AS A RESULT THE COSTS RECORDED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER ARE EXPECTED TO BE REVERSED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AS THE REGULATORY ASSET IS RECORDED GULF POWERS REPORTED ROE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 10.40% FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDING JUNE 202 FOR THE FULL YEAR 2020 WE ARE TARGETING A REGULATORY ROE OF THE UPPER HALF OF THE ALLOWED BAND OF 9.25% TO 11.25% DURING THE QUARTER GULF POWERS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE ROUGHLY A $170 MILLION AND WE NOW EXPECT OUR FULL YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO TOTAL BETWEEN 1 AND 1.1 BILLION DOLLARS ALL OF GULF MAJOR SMART CAPITAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDING THE NORTH FLORIDA RESILIENCY CONNECTION AND THE PLANT <INAUDIBLE> CALLED TO NATURAL GAS CONVERSION CONTINUE TO PROGRESS WELL SIMILAR TO OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE FLORIDA ECONOMY IS BEING IMPACTED BY THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC RECENT ECONOMIC DATA REFLECT AN INCREASE IN FLORIDA UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND A DECLINE IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE THAT ARE ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH THE CHANGES THE NATIONAL AVERAGES OF EACH METRIC WHILE IT IS STILL UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT HOW SEVERELY THE ECONOMY WILL ULTIMATELY BE IMPACTED WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES WITH WHICH FLORIDA ENTERED THE CRISIS AND THAT CONTINUED ATTRACTION OF THE STATE TO BOTH NEW RESIDENCES RESIDENCE AND NEW BUSINESSES WILL SUPPORT A REBOUND ONCE THE WORST OF THE PANDEMIC IS BEHIND US WE REMAIN DEEPLY ENGAGED IN HELPING FLORIDA RETURN FROM THIS STRONGER THAN EVER WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO OUR PART TO SUPPORT THAT OUTCOME INCLUDING PURSUING OUR SMART CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND ECONOMICAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WHICH HELP CREATE JOBS PROVIDE INVESTMENT IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FURTHER ENHANCE OUR BEST IN CLASS CUSTOMER VALUE PROPOSITION DURING THE QUARTER FPL'S AVERAGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS CONTINUED THE RECENT TREND OF STRONG UNDERLYING GROWTH INCREASING BY APPROXIMATELY 75,000 FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER FPL'S SECOND QUARTER RETAIL SALES DECREASED BY 0.8% YEAR OVER YEAR AS CUSTOMER GROWTH AND FAVORABLE WEATHER WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A DECLINE AND UNDERLYING USAGE PER CUSTOMER BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS THE OVERALL EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC ON UNDERLYING USAGE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER WERE RELATIVELY MUTED FPL BENEFITS FROM HAVING ITS RETAIL SALES BEING HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARDS RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS IN APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ITS LOAD IS COOLING RELATED AND THEREFORE IMPORTANT FOR BOTH COMFORT AND BUILDING MAINTENANCE DURING APRIL WHEN STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS WERE BROADLY IN EFFECT FPL'S WEATHER-NORMALIZED RETAIL SALES WERE DOWN APPROXIMATELY 4% RELATIVE TO OUR EXPECTATIONS AS THE ECONOMY BEGAN REOPENING IN EARLY MAY WEATHER-NORMALIZED RETAIL SALES IMPROVED AND WERE ABOVE OUR EXPECTATIONS IN JUNE WHILE THE ULTIMATE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON UNDERLYING USAGE REMAIN UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED BY OUR RESERVE AMORTIZATION MECHANISM TO OFFSET ANY FLUCTUATION OF RETAIL SALES OR BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND SUPPORT REGULATORY ROE AT THE UPPER END OF THE ALLOWED BAND OF 9.60% TO 11.6% UNDER OUR CURRENT RATE AGREEMENT FOR GULF POWER THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 1.3% VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER GULF POWERS SECOND QUARTER RETAIL SALES DECLINED BY ROUGHLY 6.2% YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE UNDER- OF THE UNFAVORABLE WEATHER COMPARISON AND A DECLINE IN UNDERLYING USAGE PER CUSTOMER OVER THE SECOND QUARTER GULF POWER EXPERIENCED A MORE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN UNDERLYING USAGE PER CUSTOMER THAN FPL BUT ALSO EXPERIENCED AN IMPROVEMENT AS THE ECONOMY BEGAN REOPENING IN MAY AND JUNE AS A REMINDER UNLIKE FPL GULF POWER DOES NOT HAVE A RESERVE AMORTIZATION MECHANISM UNDER ITS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO OFFSET FLUCTUATIONS IN REVENUE OR COSTS SO ANY VARIABILITY WILL THEREFORE HAVE MORE IMPACT ON TO GULFS EARNINGS IN ROE THAN AT FPL.AS A REMINDER AS WE'VE OFTEN DISCUSSED WEATHER-NORMALIZATION IS IMPRECISE PARTICULARLY WHEN EVALUATING SHORT PERIODS OF TIME ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON ON RETAIL SALES AT GPL AND GULF POWER ARE INCLUDED IN THE APPENDIX OF TODAY'S PRESENTATION LET ME NOW TURN TO ENERGY RESOURCES WHICH REPORTED SECOND QUARTER 2020 GAP EARNINGS OF $481 MILLION OR 0.97 CENTS PER SHARE AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS OF $531 MILLION OR A $1.08 PER SHARE THIS IS AN INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNS PER SHARE OF 13 CENTS OR APPROXIMATELY 14% FROM LAST YEARS COMPARABLE QUARTER RESULTS WHICH HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE RESULTS OF OUR NEXTERA ENERGY TRANSMISSION BUSINESS FORMALLY REPORTED IN CORPORATE <INAUDIBLE> NEW INVESTMENTS ADDED 8 CENTS PER SHARE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM EXISTING GENERATION ASSETS INCREASED 5 CENTS PER SHARE AS IMPROVED WIND RESOURCE AND INCREASED PTC VOLUMES FROM OUR REPOWERING WIND PROJECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REFUELING OUTAGE AT THE SEABROOK NUCLEAR FACILITY SECOND QUARTER FLEET WIDE WIND RESOURCE WAS 99% OF THE LONGTERM AVERAGE VERSUS 93% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 201 ALSO CONTRIBUTING FAVORABLY WAS NEXTERA ENERGY TRANSMISSION WHERE CONTRIBUTIONS INCREASED BY 3 CENTS VERSUS 201 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR GAS INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS INCLUDING EXISTING PIPELINES WERE FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR THESE FAVORABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR CUSTOMER SUPPLY AND TRADING BUSINESS WHICH DECLINE 4 CENTS VERSUS THE PARTICULARLY STRONG SECOND QUARTER LAST YEAR ALL OTHER IMPACTS INCREASED RESULTS BY 1 CENT PER SHARE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ENERGY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT TEAM HAD ANOTHER EXCELLENT QUARTER OF ORIGINATION SUCCESS ADDING 1730 MEGAWATTS TO OUR BACKLOG SINCE OUR LAST EARNING CALL WE HAVE ADDED 708 MEGAWATTS OF WIND 844 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR AND A 178 MEGAWATTS OF BATTERY STORAGE TO OUR RENEWABLES BACKLOG WE ALSO EXECUTED A BUILD-OWN TRANSFER AGREEMENT FOR A 200 MEGAWATT SOLAR PROJECT WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR BACKLOG EDITIONS ALL OUR BATTERY STORAGE PROJECTS WILL BE PAIRED WITH EITHER NEW OR EXISTING SOLAR PROJECTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ITC AND PROVIDE A MORE FIRM RENEWABLE PRODUCT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS THE CONTINUED STRONG DEMAND FOR BATTERY STORAGE PROJECTS HIGHLIGHTS THE RAPID TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PHASE OF RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT THAT PAIRS LOW COST WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY WITH A LOW COST BATTERY STORAGE SOLUTION WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS DECADE WITHOUT INCENTIVES NEW NEAR-FIRM WIND AND NEW NEAR-FIRM SOLAR WILL BE CHEAPER THAN THE OPERATING COST OF MOST EXISTING COAL AND NUCLEAR FACILITIES AND LESS UH FUEL EFFICIENT OIL AND GAS FIRED GENERATION UNITS PRODUCING SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM RENEWABLES DEMAND OUR CURRENT BACKLOG NOW TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 14,400 MEGAWATTS AND IS THE LARGEST WE HAVE EVER HAD IN OUR ROUGHLY 20 YEAR DEVELOPMENT HISTORY TO PUT OUR BACKLOG INTO CONTEXT IT IS LARGER THAN THE CURRENT OPERATING IN WIND SOLAR PORTFOLIOS OF ALL THE TWO OTHER COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AS OF YEAR END 201 HIGHLIGHTING THAT NEXTERA ENERGY CONTINUES TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF DISRUPTION THAT IS OCCURRING WITHIN THE ENERGY SECTOR ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH 2020 WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE ALREADY SIGNED NEARLY 3500 MEGAWATTS OF CONTRACTS FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2022 WHICH IS A REFLECTION OF THE CONTINUED STRONG ECONOMIC DEMAND FOR WIND SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SIGNIFICANT DEMAND IN THE COMING YEARS WE HAD NOW HAVE MORE THAN $2 BILLION OF SAFE HARBOR WIND AND SOLAR EQUIPMENT WHICH COULD SUPPORT AS MUCH AS $40 BILLION OF WIND SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE INVESTMENTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM 2021 TO 202 THESE PURCHASES HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFIT OF SCALE AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR BALANCE SHEET THAT WE LEVERAGE AS A KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT AND POSITION US WELL FOR CONTINUED LONG TERM GROWTH THE SAFE HARBOR EQUIPMENT ALSO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL REPOWERING OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING 700 MEGAWATTS OF POTENTIAL 2021 REPOWERING PROJECTS WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING AS I DISCUSSED EARLIER ALL OF THE 2020 RENEWABLES PROJECTS REMAIN ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THEIR TARGETED INSERVICE DATES THIS YEAR AS A RESULT WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE PROJECTS TO RELY ON THE UPDATED TREASURY START OF CONSTRUCTION GUIDANCE THAT WAS RELEASED DURING THE QUARTER BEYOND

PLEASED WITH THE SUPREME COURTS RULING REGARDING APPALACHIAN TRAIL CROSSING AUTHORIZATION AUTHORITY WHICH RESOLVE SIMILAR ISSUES FOR MVP WE WERE SIMILARLY PLEASED THAT THE SUPREME COURT PARTIALLY STAYED WITH THE MONTANA FEDERAL COURT'S DECISION RELATED TO THE NATIONWIDE 12 PERMIT PROGRAM AND ARE WORKING WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ON THIS REISSUANCE OF THE PROJECTS PERMIT.CALLING

WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE ON ON THAT FRONT IS THIS MORE AROUND UH TRANSPORTATION OPPORTUNITIES OR IS THIS UM AROUND LIKE UH PIPELINE AND AND BEING ABLE TO LIKE BLEND WITH THE PIPES SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT HYDROGEN IN IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GETTING TO A UM NOT A NET ZERO EMISSIONS PROFILE BUT ACTUALLY A ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS PROFILE AND FOR WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS LETS CALL IT 5 10 YEARS AGO UM AND WE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET TO TRUE UH ZERO EMISSIONS WE WERE WORRIED THAT IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE UH FOR CUSTOMERS WHAT MAKES US REALLY EXCITED ABOUT HYDROGEN PARTICULARLY IN THE 2030 AND BEYOND TIMEFRAME IS THAT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPLEMENT SIGNIFICANT DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLES INCLUDING WIND AND SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES COMPLIMENTED BY SHORT AND AND I'LL CALL IT MEDIUM TERM DURATION BATTERIES UM BUT THEN THAT LAST AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS UM THAT THAT YOU WOULD TAKE OUT OF THE SYSTEM TO GET DOWN TO ZERO COULD BE MOST ECONOMICALLY SERVED BY HYDROGEN UM SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES US EXCITED ABOUT DOING A PILOT PROJECT WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THAT TO THE FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION UM AS A WAY TO YOU KNOW FURTHER ENHANCE FPL'S ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND DELIVER THESE LONG TERM UM YOU KNOW CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS UM AND AS PART OF THAT WE'LL LEARN ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES AND WE'LL SEE WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE UH POTENTIALLY FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SECTORS UM YOU KNOW AND AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PRO- YOU KNOW PRODUCE THAT UH THE GREEN ENERGY TO PRODUCE THE GREEN HYDROGEN UH IS A POTENTIAL SIGNIF- SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US WE THINK WE'RE AT THE EARLY STAGES UM WHICH IS KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH OUR TOE IN THE WATER APPROACH WE WANT TO GET SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT OBVIOUSLY DO A LOT OF RESEARCH UM AND UH TALK TO FOLKS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND AND GET BETTER EQUIPPED TO DEAL UH YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES BUT WERE REALLY

WHEN WE FIND GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH YOU KNOW AGAIN I CAN HIGHLIGHT ENOUGH ABOUT HOW EXCITED WE ARE ABOUT THE RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS AT AT ENERGY RESOURCES SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONSTRAIN THEM IN ANY WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL DEVELOP THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT CREATE VALUE FOR SHAREHOLDERS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN UM BALANCE OVER TIME WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT THAT ARE CREATED FOR SHAREHOLDERS UM INCLUDING RECYCLING OF CAPITAL THROUGH NEXTERA ENERGY PARTNERS UM WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A WILLING AND EXCITED ACQUIRER OF ENERGY RESOURCES PROJECTS UM BUT ENERGY RESOURCES HAS THE ABILITY TO RECYCLE CAPITAL TO THIRD PARTIES AS WELL UH SO THERE'S PLENTY OF WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN UH CREATE THE REAL YOU KNOW VALUE OF CREATIVE OPPORTUNITIES UM AND STILL THINK ABOUT IT FROM A CORPORATIVE PERSPECTIVE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS THANKS THAT'S UH NO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND UH KIND OF PIVOTING A LITTLE BIT TO TO SOMETHING A

IN THE ECONOMY ARE REALLY YOU KNOW REALLY FRANKLY TRANSCEND WHAT HAPPENS IN ELECTIONS AND SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE WATCH THEM CLOSELY WE THINK UH GOOD CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES IMPORTANT AND THE RIGHT POLICY FOR FOR FOR AMERICA AND THE FUTURE AND UH YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE I THINK TO BE POSITIONED UH REALLY WELL REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS IN NOVEMBER OKAY THAT MAKES SENSE I'LL I'LL UH TELL THAT TO <INAUDIBLE> THANKS SO MUCH <INAUDIBLE> THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MICHAEL WEINSTEIN FROM CREDIT SWISS PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOU QUESTION HI GOOD MORNING GUYS HEY UM ON THE SAME QUESTION JIM ARE YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME FROM THE CONGRESS THESE DAY TAX CREDIT EXTENSIONS CASH GRANTS DO YOU THINK A NATIONAL RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD IS A POSSIBILITY I'M JUST WONDERING OF ALL THOSE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES WHAT DO YOU THINK MIGHT ACTUALLY OCCUR IN THE NEXT UH FOUR YEARS YEAH YOU KNOW SO I THINK ITS HONESTLY UH TOO SOON TO TELL MICHAEL I THINK UH YOU KNOW A LOT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ELECTION AND IS THERE A CONTINUED SPLIT GOVERNMENT OR IS THERE NOT SPLIT GOVERNMENT UH THAT'LL BE I THINK A BIG DRIVER OF WHAT POLICIES HAPPEN AND UH YOU KNOW I THINK UH ALL OF THOSE IDEAS ARE ON THE TABLE WE WE BE CONSISTENT IN IN IN WHAT WE'VE SAID WHICH IS THAT UH UH YOU KNOW WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE UH YOU KNOW GOOD AND FAIR CLEAN ENERGY POLICY GOING FORWARD UH WE ALSO HAVE SAID THAT IT'S UH THAT WE THINK WIND AND AND RENEWABLES WITH BATTERIES WILL BE UH YOU KNOW ARE VERY COMPETITIVE UH YOU KNOW ONCE THE PTC'S AND THE RTC'S PHASE OUT IN TERMS OF UH COMPETING AGAINST CONVENTIONAL GENERATION IT'S JUST HONESTLY UH REALLY MORE A MATTER OF THE SPEED WITH WHICH YOU WANT TO DECARBONIZE IS WHAT I GONNA ULTIMATELY DRIVE THE FINAL UH I THINK POLICY CHOICES AND SO UH YOU KNOW WE'RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND UH UH I THINK IT'S PREMATURE REALLY TO SAY WHAT WE THINK UH IS GONNA HAPPEN CAUSE I THINK YOU HAVE AN ELECTION IN FOUR FIVE MONTHS AND AS AS YOU ALL KNOW ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND UH AND YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS POST THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GONNA BE UH UH THE POLICY WHEN <INAUDIBLE> GOING FOR GREAT HEY UM ON HYDROGEN DO YOU THINK I NOTICED THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT MORE EMPHASIS ON RENEWABLES RATHER THAN GAS TURBINES IN YOUR FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PLANS AT FPL I'M JUST WONDERING IF UH IF HYDROGEN WORKS OUT IS THAT A MESSAGE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD ACTUALLY BUILD MORE UH PUT MORE GAS TURBINES BACK INTO THE PLAN IF IF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BECOMES A VIABLE ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVE UH OR DO YOU THINK OTHER ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE BETTER SUITED SUCH AS FUEL CELLS MIKE I THINK UM YOU KNOW FROM A HYDROGEN PERSPECTIVE UH AND SPECIFIC TO FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL HYDROGEN OPPORTUNITIES REALLY IN THE 2030 AND BEYOND TIMEFRAME UM AND IN THAT INTERVENING TIME WE DEPLOY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SOLAR TECHNOLOGY AND THEN IF WE'RE RIGHT AND IF THE COST COME DOWN FOR HYDROGEN AND IT IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE FOR SUPPORTING GETTING TO A ZERO EMISSIONS UH PROFILE UH WE WOULD UH RETROFIT CERTAIN OF OUR YOU KNOW GAS FACILITIES TO RUN ON HYDROGEN OR RUN ON A PORTION OF HYDROGEN SO I THINK FOR FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHTING GULF POWER IT'S AT THIS POINT AND AGAIN IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LONG WAY INTO THE FUTURE UH YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BUILD ANY NEW YOU KNOW HYDROGEN/GAS TURBINES IN THAT IN THAT PORTFOLIO CAUSE WE'VE GOT A TREMENDOUSLY EFFICIENT UH FLEET THAT'S ALREADY IN SERVICES ON THE INVESTMENTS WE WOULD MAKE FOR REALLY AROUND CONVERSION.NOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY I THINK IT'S UM YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT UM BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD AND A LOT OF THINGS NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO HAVE THOSE TYPES OF CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIRLY PRELIMINARY GOTCHA AND YOU KNOW ONE FINAL QUESTION UH THIS MAY YOU'RE COMING ON M&A INTEREST THESE DAYS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH SANDY COOPER ET CETERA SO I THINK WE UH THIS WON'T BE SURPRISING WE REMAIN INTERESTED IN M&A UH WE THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN BRING TO THE THE TABLE WE YOU KNOW I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NOT A UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY THAT WE COULDN'T RUN UH MORE EFFICIENTLY AND UH UH BETTER FOR CUSTOMERS AND I I TRULY BELIEVE THAT AND AND SO YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO LOOK I THINK IN TERMS OF SANDY COOPER UH YOU KNOW THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN PUSHED TO NEXT YEAR AND WE REMAIN YOU KNOW WE REMAIN VERY INTERESTED AND UH AND CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON UH TRYING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN UH HEY JIM CAN YOU WHAT REGION OF THE COUNTRY ARE YOU FOCUSED ON JUST CURIOUS WE WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON THE MID-WEST AND THE SOUTHEAST GOTCHA ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM <CROSSTALK> PLUS FOR REGULATED ASSETS PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE UH PERFECT OKAY THANKS A LOT THANK YOU OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM STEVEN <INAUDIBLE> FROM MORGAN STANLEY PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION HI THANKS IT'S STEVE <INAUDIBLE> ON FOR STEVEN THANKS FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UH I HAVE ONE QUICK FOLLOWUP JUST ON THE HYDROGEN TOPIC WONDERING IF YOU SEE A POTENTIAL PATH FOR THIS TO BE A POTENTIAL PATH FOR THIS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY AT NEWARK AND ALSO IN TERMS OF KIND OF BUSINESS MODEL UM THAT YOU THINK YOU WOULD ENVISION BEING INVOLVED IN OWNING THE ELECTROLYSIS FUNCTION UH WITHIN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN UM AND IF SO SO YOU HAVE A KIND OF A VISION OR VIEWS ON UH WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS AHEAD OF OTHERS AT THIS POINT THANKS STEVE YEAH I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT WE'RE LOOKING FR OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO UM OBVIOUSLY WE TALKED ABOUT THE PILOT PROJECT FPL TODAY BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER PILOT TYPES OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE IN THE PORTFOLIO UH CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THAT WE APPROACH SOL- SOLAR EARLY ON AND OF COURSE BATTERIES UM MORE RECENTLY SO I THINK THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER TIME UH FOR THOSE TYPE OF PILOT PROJECTS YOU KNOW AGAIN WHERE YOU THINK OF IT AS ACTUALLY BEING CLOSED ECONOMIC TODAY ARE AREAS WHERE THERE'S ALREADY SIGNIFICANT PENETRATION OF RENEWABLES UM BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW IT'S CRITICAL TO FIND THAT LOW COST ELECTRICITY SUPPLY UM IN ORDER TO MAKE IT ECONOMIC OR CLOSE TO ECONOMIC UM AND HER IN THE US YOU KNOW THE ECONOMICS CERTAINLY HAVE TO FACTOR IN THAT TODAY THERE'S A VERY LOW COST SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS MAKING IT YOU KNOW THE IMPERATIVE THAT YOU YOU FIND A A CHEAP ELECTRICITY SUPPLY YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY UM YOU KNOW NEVER SAY NEVER ON ON YOU KNOW WHERE WE MIGHT FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS BUT HISTORICALLY UM AS YOU KNOW WE'VE NOT UH PLAYED IN THE SPACE OF OWNING UH YOU KNOW BEING A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UH YOU KNOW OWNER OF TECHNOLOGIES OR OR PROJECTS UH WE TYPICALLY UM TAKE IN THE BEST OF UM MANUFACTURED EQUIPMENT FROM OTHER FOLKS UM YOU KNOW APPLY OUR SCALE AND OUR ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT OWN AND OPERATE OVER THE LONG TERM EFFECTIVELY IS WHERE WE CREATE VALUE SO AGAIN IT'S EARLY BUT AT THIS POINT I WOULDN'T THINK THAT WE WOULD UH FOCUS ON VERTICALLY INTEGRATING IT'S MORE OF UM YOU KNOW APPLYING HYDROGEN AS A AS A TECHNOLOGY CONSISTENT THE WAY THAT WE'VE UH CREATED VALUE IN THE PAST SO SO THE ONLY I WOULD ADD TO THAT TWO THINGS ONE IS I WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF UH IN JOHN'S BUSINESS WE DON'T MAKE SOME KIND OF PILOT INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT YEAR UH WERE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF THINGS AND I'D BE DISAPPOINTED IF WE DON'T MAKE SOME KIND OF PILOT INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT YEAR A VERY VERY MUCH TOE IN THE WATER LIKE WE DID A DECADE AGO IN THE BATTERY STORAGE BUSINESS SECONDLY UH YOU KNOW CLEARLY WERE NOT GONNA BACKWARD INTEGRATE INTO MANUFACTURING UH ELECTROLIZERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT UH I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T RULE OUT US OWNING THEM AS PART OF A UH INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT WAS INTEGRATED WITH RENEWABLES TO MANUFACTURE HYDROGEN AND AND IS YOU KNOW OUR VIEW WOULD AROUND THAT WOULD BE IF WE HAD A LONG TERM CONTRACT AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE ACCESS TO VERY UH EFFICIENT CAPITAL WE KNOW HOW TO OPERATE EQUIPMENT UM WE'RE YOU KNOW AND SO A LOT OF THAT WOULD WOULD COME TO OUR I THINK OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF WE HOW WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE VALUE FOR FOLKS SO YOU KNOW I THINK IT I THINK IT'S EARLY WE'RE WE'RE WE ARE THERE'S CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO UH YOU KNOW FIVE TO YOU KNOW FIVE TO TEN YEARS FROM NOW TO DISPLACE THE LAST 10% OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS OUT OF THE ELECTRIC SECTOR BY MANUFACTURING HYDROGEN IN WITH RENEWABLES THAT'S CLEAR I THINK THERE'S ALSO CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE RENEWABLES TO DISPLACE DIESEL FUEL AND PERHAPS EVEN UH OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION FUEL GOING FORWARD AND THERE'S ALSO I THINK CLEARLY UH AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREEN HYDROGEN TO UM TO REP- UH TO REPLACE OTHER TYPES OF HYDROGEN OR AND OTHER FEEDSTOCKS IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT AND WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT BEING UH ALL OF THAT IN THE END COMES BACK TO UH A VERY IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE GIGAWATTS AND GIGAWATTS AND GIGAWATTS AND GIGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE DEMAND IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO THERE IS NO ONE BETTER POSITIONED THAN US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND WE'RE GONNA BE JUST LIKE WE WERE ON BATTERY STORAGE WE'RE GONNA BE AT THE VANGUARD WE'RE GONNA UH AND WE'RE GONNA THIS IS A BIG STRATEGIC INITIATIVE FOR US AND WE'RE GONNA DRIVE IT AND UH IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT UH FOR THIS COMPANY I THINK NOT YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT OVER THE NEXT DECADE WE WON'T MAKE ANY MONEY ON IT IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS JUST LIKE WE DIDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY IN BATTERIES IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AND NEXT YEAR WE'RE DEP- WE'RE DEPLOYING A BILLION DOLLARS OFF BATTERIES UH TEN YEARS LATER AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THIS I THINK ABOUT THIS AS IS HELP POWERING THE LONG TERM GROWTH OF THIS COMPANY INTO UH THE BACK HALF OF THIS DECADE AND THE AND THE NEXT DECADE AS WELL GOT IT THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS UM I I JUST HAD ONE OTHER QUICK M&A FOLLOWUP I WAS JUST WONDERING IF UH IS THERE ANY PATH FOR TEXAS TO BE A TARGET UM OF INTEREST FOR YOU FROM AN M&A PERSPECTIVE OR WHAT WOULD NEED TO CHANGE THERE THANKS SO WE WE WE UH WE HAVE UH SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN TEXAS OBVIOUSLY WE OWN ASSETS IN TEXAS AND SO UH WE ARE GREAT OPERATIVE AND UH AND AND WE FEEL LIKE WE WOULD BRING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF STATE WE WE OWN BILLION OF DOLLARS OF ASSETS IN THE STATE RIGHT AND WE'RE A GREAT GREAT PARTNER FOR THE STATE AND SO UM YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER SAY NEVER UM YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY UH WE WERE EXTRAORDINARILY DISAPPOINTED IN THE ENCORE DECISION WE THINK IT WAS UH UH A MISTAKE AND SHORTSIGHTED BUT YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT IT IS AND UH SO IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE A BIT TO GET PAST THAT BEFORE UH I I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT DOING THINGS IN TEXAS FROM A M&A STANDPOINT UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MICHAEL <INAUDIBLE> FROM GOLDMAN SACHS PLEASE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION HI GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY QUESTION UM I WANT TO TURN TO FLORIDA FOR A SECOND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO <INAUDIBLE> CASES NEXT YEAR UH AT BOTH UTILITIES AND OBVIOUSLY THE COMBINATION OF IT IT WILL BE A BIG FAT SUBJECT IS THERE ANY POTENTIAL FOR BEING ABLE TO DELAY OR DEFER THE TIMING OF THE RATE CASES TO A SEE WHAT HAPPENS FROM A TAX PERSPECTIVE IN D.C FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE JUST SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE REGULATOR TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER A TWO OR THREE YEAR PERIOD AND B IS IS THERE ANY SCENARIO WHERE YOU MAY BOT EVEN NEED A RATE CASE OR RATE PER WEEK GOOD MORNING MICHAEL AND AND UH WE APPRECIATE THE UH THE QUESTION UM AS AS I'VE COMMENTED I THINK EVEN IN THESE PREPARED REMARKS UM WE DO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE UM THAT FPL AND GULF WOULD FILE FOR A COMBINED RATE CASE IN EARLY 20 ' 21 FROM RATES EFFECTIVE IN 202 UM AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED THERE'S THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTIES AND CERTAIN FACTORS THAT CAN CHANGE BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF OPERATING ANY BUSINESS UH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS AND AND YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR FOR PLANNING FOR UNCERTAINTIES AND UM WE CERTAINLY WOULD CONTEMPLATE UM CHANGES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF AT THE TIME UM BUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOTTA KEEP RUNNING YOUR BUSINESS AND WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS CONTINUING TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT AND TO INVEST AT GULF POWER UM IN THESE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE UH FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUT CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN O&M COST WE CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN RELIABILITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE UM AND THE BEST WAY TO KEEP DOING THAT IS EXECUTE UM AND THAT MEANS OCCASIONALLY HAVING RATE CASES UM WE ARE UM EXCITED ABOUT THAT PROSPECT WE'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME UM AND WE THINK WE HAVE UM A GREAT STORY TO TELL UM AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AT AT FPL AND GULF SO WE'RE RIGHT FOR NOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT OBVIOUSLY THINGS COULD CHANGE BUT FOR NOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE PLANS TO TO FILE IN ' 21 FOR A NEW LEASE EFFECTIVE 202 ALL RIGHT AND ONE OTHER QUESTION JUST ON THE FLORIDA UTILITIES YOU YOU HAVE BEEN THE INDUSTRY LEADER IN TERMS OF COST MANAGEMENT DO YOU THINK THE PACE OF CHANGE IN O&M COST TO CLIENTS WILL STAY AT AT THIS LEVEL MEANING THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE OR DECLINE RATES WOULD YOU THINK THEY'RE REACHING A POINT WHERE IT'LL START TO FLATTEN OUT WHERE THE ABILITY TO TAKE OUT AS MUCH COST AS YOU'VE DONE EVERY YEAR WILL START TO SLOW THE SHORTEST ANSWER TO THAT MICHAEL IS WE'VE GOT A VERY CREATIVE TEAM AND WE'VE GOT A TEAM THAT IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND NOT AFRAID OF THAT UM BUT IT LET ME ALSO NOT UNDERESTIMATE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT REQUIRES AND THAT REQUIRES UM THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND TAKE THAT COST OUT OVER OVER TIME SO THERE'S YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO WORK FOR IT UM AND SO EVERY YEAR WE WOULD PULL TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH OUR BEST IDEAS UH DO WE THINK OVER THE LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE'VE EXHAUSTED EVERY OPPORTUNITY NO IN PART BECAUSE I THINK TECHNOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT BUT IT TAKES TIME TO EXECUTE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES UM SO OUR DISCIPLINE IS THERE OUR CREATIVITY IS THERE OUR INNOVATION UM OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WERE GONNA DO THE BEST WE CAN TO TO CREATE THE BEST VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS GOT IT THANK YOU REBECCA MUCH APPRECIATED"""

NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and continued to perform well both financially and operationally while managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers, we continue to operate under our principles of pandemic plan that we activated last quarter. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 11% versus the prior year comparable quarter, and we are well positioned to meet our overall objectives for the year. FPL increased earnings per share by 15 cents year over year, and its strong execution continues across the board. During the quarter, FPL set a new system peak load of more than 24,500 megawatts. Transmission and Distribution Systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards, and our highly efficient generating facilities remain available to serve our customers. FPL's continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investments that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions. Consistent with enhancing its best-in-class customer value, proposition, last month FPL announced plans to retire Share 4, its last remaining coal unit. Together with our joint interest owner, JEA, and subject to certain approvals from the Florida Public Service Commission, FPL intends to retire the 847 megawatt coal-fired plant in early 2022. The retirement of Share 4 is projected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for FPL customers and prevent roughly 4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from this unit. Share4's retirement is the final step of the coal phase-out strategy that FPL launched in 2015 and that will complete the closure of approximately 2,700 megawatts of coal capacity, including the highest greenhouse-emitting gas power plants in Florida. These transactions, which will make FPL one of the first utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio, demonstrate FPL's continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader. We remain proud of our environmental track record, particularly the CO2 emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout Florida and across the country. And we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on operational cost effectiveness at Gulf continues to progress well, with year-to-date O&M costs excluding specific COVID-19-related expenses declining by nearly 10% versus the prior year comparable period, and by approximately 25% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and continued its significant improvement in employee safety with no OSHA recordables year-to-date through the end of June. We remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. completed our annual storm drills for FPL and Gulf Power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety. The drills provided a number of lessons, including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur, when performing storm restoration in the midst of a pandemic. While we hope that our service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year, consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution, we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by 13 cents year-over-year. The Energy Resources team continued to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low-cost renewables. adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call. This continued origination success through the ongoing pandemic is a testament to the energy resources' significant competitive advantages, including our best-in-class renewables development skills. Our engineering and construction team also continues to execute, commissioning roughly 650 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately 4,400 megawatts of wind and solar projects we expect to complete this year on track, despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally. While we are monitoring the situation closely, we continue to expect that all of our planned 2020 renewables projects will achieve their in-service dates this year. In response to increased investor focus on environmental, social, and governance issues, or ESG, next week we expect to publish NextEra Energy's updated ESG report, which includes reporting under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, disclosures. Our company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years. XR Energy's approach to governance and risk oversight, combined with the way that we treat our people, our customers, our communities, and the environment, are proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time. The new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy DSG, includes a robust discussion of risk oversight, and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics. Diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company, both because we believe they are the right thing to do, but also because diverse and inclusive teams deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve. Our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new, and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry. However, consistent with our focus on continuous improvement, we are not satisfied and will continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in extra energy so far in 2020. Headed into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full-year expectations that we have previously discussed, even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic. the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $749 million, or $1.52 per share, which is an increase of $86 million and 15 cents per share, respectively, year over year. Regulatory capital employed increased by more than 10% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 13%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.8 in the second quarter, and we now expect our full-year capital investments to total between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% allowed under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we utilized $7 million of reserve amortization of our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $736 million. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during 2021. As we previously discussed, we expect that FPL and Gulf will operate as a single larger Florida utility company, which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers. in May, the companies filed an application with FERC for an approval of an internal reorganization whereby Gulf would merge into FPL. Subject to FERC approval, the companies will merge in January of 2021. However, during 2021, Gulf Power will continue to operate as a separate operating division, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. We continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in January 2022. Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital initiatives at FPL remain on track and on budget. During the quarter, the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment, or SOBR, mechanism of FPL's Base Rate Settlement Agreement were placed into service. The 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective solar constructed under the SOBR mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent the early stages of FPL's rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts. The next six Solar Together projects, totaling approximately 450 megawatts, remain on track to be placed in service later this year. The final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1,500 megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year. Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in 2022. Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Storage Facility, which will be one of the world's largest battery storage plants, is on track and on budget to be complete next year. Based on our ongoing analysis of the long-term potential of low-cost renewables, we remain confident as ever that wind, solar, and battery storage will be hugely disruptive to the country's existing generation. while reducing costs for customers and helping to achieve future CO2 emissions reductions. However, to achieve an emissions-free future, we believe that other technologies will be necessary, and we are particularly excited about the long-term potential of hydrogen. Consistent with the tow-in-the-water approach we've previously utilized with solar and battery storage, we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at FTL. This approximately $65 million pilot project, which, subject to Florida Public Service Commission approval, is expected to be in service in 2023, will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce 100% green hydrogen through a roughly 20-megawatt electrolysis system. The hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We believe that the project is a complement to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts. and highlights FPL's continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers. We continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses, and while our near-term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program, we are excited about the technology's long-term potential, which should further support future demand for low-cost renewables, as well as accelerate the decarbonization, of transportation, fuel, and industrial feedstocks. We continue to expect that FPL's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022, while further enhancing our best-in-class customer value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2020 gap earnings of $55 million, or 11 cents per share, of one cent per share relative to Gulf Power's adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period. This quarter results include the impact of roughly $5 million of after-tax COVID-19-related expenses, primarily reflecting the expected incremental bad debt expense as a result of the pandemic. Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission approved Gulf Power's request to record costs attributable to COVID-19, including bad debt expense, as a regulatory asset on its balance sheet. As a result, the costs recorded during the second quarter are expected to be reversed during the third quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending June 2020. For the full year 2020, we are targeting a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures, were roughly $170 million, and we now expect our full-year capital investments to total between $1.0 and $1.1 billion. All of Gulf's major smart capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant-CRIST coal-to-natural gas conversion, continue to progress well. Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. and Florida unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes to the national averages of each metric. While it is still unclear at this point how severely the economy will ultimately be impacted, we continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages with which Florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever. We will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our Smart Capital Investment Program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities, and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately 75,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's second quarter retail sales decreased by 0.8% year over year, as customer growth and favorable weather were more than offset by a decline in underlying usage per customer. Based on our analysis, the overall effects of the pandemic on underlying usage during the second quarter were relatively muted. FPL benefits from having its retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers, and approximately 40% of its load is cooling-related, Thank you. retail sales or bad debt expense and support regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.3% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales declined by roughly 6.2% year-over-year as a result of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage per customer. Over the second quarter, Gulf Power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage for customers in FPL, but also experienced an improvement as the economy began reopening in May and June. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs. So any variability would therefore have more impact to Gulf's earnings and ROE than at FPL. whether normalization is imprecise, particularly when evaluating short periods of time. Additional details on retail sales at FPL and Gulf Power are included in the appendix of today's presentation. Let me now turn to energy resources, which reported second quarter 2020 gap earnings of $481 million, or $0.97 per share, and adjusted earnings of $531 million, or $1.08 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, or approximately 14% from last year's comparable quarter results, which have been restated to reflect the results of our Nexter Energy transmission business, formerly reported in Corporate & Other. New investments added $0.08 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.05 per share as improved wind resource and increased PTC volume from our repowered wind projects were partially offset by the refueling outage at the Seabrook Nuclear Facility. wind resource was 99% of the long-term average versus 93% during the second quarter of 2019. Also contributing favorably was NextRNG transmission, where contributions increased by 3 cents versus 2019. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business, including existing pipelines, were flat year over year. These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, which declined 4 cents versus the particularly strong second quarter last year. All other impacts increased results by one cent per share. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources Development Team had another excellent quarter of origination success, adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added 708 megawatts of wind, 844 megawatts of solar, and 178 megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog. We also executed a build-own transfer agreement for a 200-megawatt solar project, which is not included in our backlog additions. All of the battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the ITC and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers. The continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade, without incentives, new near-firm wind and new near-firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel-efficient oil and gas fire generation units, producing significant long-term renewables demand. Our current backlog now totals approximately 14,400 megawatts and is the largest we have ever had To put our backlog into context, it is larger than the current operating and wind solar portfolios of all but two other companies in the world as of year-end 2019, highlighting that Nextdoor Energy continues to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. Only halfway through 2020, we are pleased to have already signed nearly 3,500 megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond 2022, which is a reflection of the continued strong, economic demand for wind, solar, and battery storage. To ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years, we now have more than $2 billion of Safe Harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $40 billion of wind, solar, and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. These purchases highlight the benefits of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we leverage as a key competitive advantage in renewables development and position us well for continued long-term growth. The State Harbor equipment also supports additional repowering opportunities, including several hundred megawatts of potential 2021 repowering projects, which we are currently evaluating. As I discussed earlier, all of the 2020 renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted in-service dates this year. As a result, we do not expect these projects to rely on the Thank you. Y-12 permit program and are working with the Army Corps of Engineers on its reissuance of the project's permit. Following comprehensive restudy by the relevant agencies, we expect issuance of MVPs for revised biological opinion shortly. Assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues, we are now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during early 2021 and expect an overall project estimate in the range of $5.4 to $5.7 billion. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy for the second quarter of 2020, GapNet income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.275 billion, or $2.59 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.286 billion and $2.61 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other declined by one cent year over year, NextEra Energy also delivered strong year-to-date operating cash flow growth and, for the full year 2020, expects to generate roughly $8.5 billion in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position. NextEra Energy maintains approximately $13 billion in liquidity to support the largest capital investment program in our history. Since last quarter's call, we've completed roughly $3 billion in long-term financings. of $2.2 billion in capital holdings to ventures. Over the course of the last few months, we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during March and April and converted these commitments to bilateral revolving credit facilities. Included in these facilities is a total of more than $1 billion in six-month storm facilities at FPL and Gulf Power, which, similar to previous years, we put in place to ensure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane. Energy Resources also closed two tax equity financings, including its first-ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing, and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financings as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year. Our year-to-date financing activities are evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time, which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects. financial expectations remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off of the 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. While our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined. In summary, despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward. We have a long-term track record of delivering results for our customers and shareholders, and we remain intensely focused on continuing that track record. Based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021, and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that NextGen Energy is well positioned to drive long-term shareholder value over the coming years. Let me now turn to NextGen Energy Partners, which continued its strong start to 2020 with growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 23% and 46%, respectively, from the prior year comparable quarter. distribution have increased by 26% and 86%, respectively, versus 2019. The strong operational and financial performance that highlights the Next Energy Partners remains well-positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the Next Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $57.75 per common unit, or $2.31 per common unit, on an annualized basis, our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12 to 15 percent per year growth range. We were pleased to see PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy earlier this month. As expected, all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification. Following PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy, Next Energy Partners received a cash distribution of approximately $65 million from our Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects, which represent current distributions and those The release of the Desert Sunlight trap cash supplements Next Energy Partners' liquidity, which was approximately $650 million, including cash on hand, at the end of the second quarter. The organic growth investments at Next Energy Partners continue to progress well. The approximately 275 megawatts of wind repowering and the Texas pipelines expansion both remain on track to be in service later this year. We continue to expect to execute on a due date. Thank you. distribution includes all contributions from PG&E-related projects. New projects added $51 million in adjusted EBITDA and $36 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution, as resource was favorable across the portfolio. For the second quarter, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 94% in the prior year comparable quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project-level debt service, primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repowerings. The reduction in project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate-level interest expense. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees since we treat these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. unchanged. Next Energy Partners continues to expect December 31, 2020 run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion, and cash available for distribution in the range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at the end of 2020. Now that the PG&E bankruptcy has been favorably resolved, we will no longer provide CAFTE expectations, including contributions excluding the contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects. As a reminder, these expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February of 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. Similar to NextGen Energy, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations. With resumption of cash distributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, we now expect to achieve NextGen Energy Partners' distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 70%, highlighting the significant flexibility we believe NextGenergy Partners has going forward. As we've previously discussed, while we will continue to be opportunistic, NextGenergy Partners' favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022. Thank you. to its growth going forward. Following another strong quarter of origination, Energy Resources' portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than 27 gigawatts, including the signed backlog of projects that Energy Resources plans to build in the coming years. When combined with the prospects for future renewables development, Next Energy Partners' long-term growth visibility remains as strong as ever. Next Energy Partners' cost of capital and access to capital advantages, including significant demand from various low-cost private infrastructure capital, provide flexibility to finance this growth over the long term. These strengths, together with NextEnergy Partners' favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights, leave NextEnergy Partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward. In closing, we believe that the fundamental value proposition of NextEnergy and NextEnergy Partners Both companies remain resilient and well-positioned to deliver on their commitments. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and are focused on delivering smart capital investments that enhance value for both customers and shareholders and expand our position as the world's leading clean energy provider. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we will open up the line for questions. If you would like to ask a question, please press star and then one using a touch-tone telephone. To withdraw your questions, you may press star and two. If you are using a speaker phone, we do ask that you please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers to ensure the best sound quality. Once again, that is star and then one to ask a question. We'll pause momentarily to assemble the roster. First question today comes from Julian Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Hey, good morning. This is actually Richie here for Julian. Just had a question around the CapEx raise at FTL and Gulf. What was driving that? Is that more around undergrounding, grid hardening, or is that more on the solar side? And after we think about the CapEx trajectory from 21 and beyond, is that more in line with what you disclosed at your analyst day? or should we expect it to be at more of these robust levels going forward? Richie, good morning, and thanks for the question. I think it really reflects consistency with what we've been talking about for a long time, which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities, and we're starting to put those in place. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we do have consistent expectations for the growth rate, between 2018 and 2022 of a 9% compound annual growth rate. So obviously some projects move from one year to another. But at the heart of it, it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers. As far as beyond 2022, you know, similar to comments that we've made in the past, the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses, but specific at FPL and Gulf Power, include the modernization efforts, including the large deployment of solar over time, as well as investments in grid hardening and undergrounding as highlighted by the storm protection plan that we're in the process of going through approvals and initial investments for that program. So we're super excited about the opportunities for investing and, again, stay very focused on ensuring that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers. Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just around your comments around hydrogen, disclose $65 million for that pilot project. What are you seeing there on that front? Is this more around transportation opportunities or is this all around pipeline and being able to blend with pipes? We're really excited about hydrogen. In particular, when we think about getting to not a net zero emissions profile, but a zero carbon emissions profile. And when we looked at this, let's call it five, ten years ago, and we thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions, we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for customers. What makes us really excited about hydrogen, particularly in the 2030 and beyond timeframe, is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables, including wind and solar technologies, complemented by and I'll call it medium-term duration batteries. But then that last amount of emissions that you would take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen. So that's what makes us excited about doing a pilot project. We're very excited about the opportunity to present that to the Florida Public Service Commission as a way to further enhance FPL's ability to innovate and deliver these long-term clean energy solutions to our customers. And as part of that, we'll learn about the technologies, and we'll see what other opportunities there are potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors. And for us to be able to produce the green energy to produce the green hydrogen is a potential significant opportunity for us. We think we're at the early stages, which is kind of consistent with our toe-in-the-water approach. We want to get some experience with it, obviously do a lot of research to folks in the supply chain and get better equipped to deal, you know, take advantage of these opportunities. But we're really excited about it. All right. Thanks a lot. That's all the questions I had. Thank you, Richie. Our next question comes from Char Perez from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Hi. Good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Char as well. Congratulations on a great quarter. We've definitely seen some impressive numbers with backlog additions and contract increases for the 2022 timeframe. Just kind of curious on your thoughts around NEAR's growth trajectory and contribution to the business mix. It's kind of subsided as a conversation point from the rating agencies, but just thoughts on growing contributions from NEAR versus balancing that from the regulated contributions. Are you thinking about both on acquisition? or any kind of drop-downs accelerated from near? Just some thoughts around that. Thanks, Constantine. We appreciate you dialing in this morning. We're really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment across the board. And, of course, at FPL and Gulf, that's focused on investments that need to create value for our customers. And at Energy Resources, it's return-focused, along with delivering things for our customers there, too. We don't want to limit any of our businesses when we find great investment opportunities, which, you know, again, I can't highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at Energy Resources. So we're not going to constrain them in any way. You know, we will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders. And to the extent that we want to maintain balance over time, we've got a lot of opportunities to do that that are accretive for shareholders, including recycling of capital through Next Energy Partners, which is a great way to do that. He's obviously a willing and excited acquirer of energy resources projects. But energy resources has the ability to recycle capital to third parties as well. So there's plenty of ways to ensure that we can create the real value of creative opportunities and still think about it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways. Thanks. That's very helpful. And kind of pivoting a little bit to something a little bit longer term, I guess, Let me get some of your thoughts on the November election and kind of the Biden campaign has put out some plans and frameworks out there, higher tax rate, clean energy support. How is NextEra positioned for kind of potential changes at the federal level? So this is Jim. You know, we always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections. So, you know, we – I think you can remember back three – you know, close to four years ago now, there was some turmoil around our stock when President Trump was elected. We've managed completely fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our renewable business because, you know what, it's all about economics, right? kind of transcends politics, frankly. The economics and the need to, you know, and really the need to decarbonize not only the electric sector, but the rest of the sectors of the economy are really, you know, really frankly transcend what happens in elections. And so, you know, obviously we watch them closely. We think good clean energy policy is important and the right policy for America in the future. And, you know, continue, I think, to be positioned really well regardless of who wins in November. Okay. That makes sense. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks so much. Congrats. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Hi. Good morning, guys. Hey, on the same question, Jim, what do you think is the most likely outcome from the Congress these days? Tax credit extensions, cash grants? Do you think a national renewable portfolio standard is a possibility? I'm just wondering, of all those different alternatives, what do you think might actually occur in the next four years? You know, so I think it's honestly too soon to tell, Michael. I think, you know, a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election. and is there continued split government or is there not split government, that'll be, I think, a big driver of what policies happen. And, you know, I think all of those ideas are on the table. We've been consistent in what we've said, which is that, you know, we think it's important to have, you know, good and fair clean energy policy going forward. We also have said that it's, that we think wind and renewables with batteries will be, you know, are very competitive, you know, once the PTCs and the ITCs phase out in terms of competing against conventional generation. It's just honestly really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what is going to ultimately drive the final, I think, policy choices. And so, you know, we are, you know, obviously we're actively, engaged in the discussions, and I think it's premature, really, to say what we think is going to happen, because I think you have an election in four or five months, and as you all know, elections have consequences, and we'll see what happens post the election in terms of what's going to be the policy landscape going forward. Great. Hey, on hydrogen, do you think, and I notice there's a lot more to some renewables rather than gas turbines in your future construction plants at FDL. And I'm just wondering if hydrogen works out, is that a method? Do you think you could actually build more, put more gas turbines back into the plan if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative? Or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited, such as fuel cells? to Power and Light Company, we're talking about potential hydrogen opportunities really in the 2030 and beyond timeframe. And in that intervening time, we deploy a significant amount of solar technology. And then if we're right and if the costs come down for hydrogen and it is the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile, we would retrofit certain of our gas facilities to run on hydrogen or run on a portion of hydrogen. So I think for Florida Power and Light and Gulf Power, you know, it's at this point, and again, we're talking about a long way into the future, you wouldn't necessarily need to build any new, you know, hydrogen-slash-gas turbines in that portfolio because we've got a tremendously efficient fleet that's already in service, and the investments we would make were really around conversion. Now, whether or not that's true elsewhere in the country I think is, you know, it might be a little bit different, the road and a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations. I think it's fairly preliminary. Gotcha. And one final question. Just make a comment on M&A interest these days, what's going on with Santee Cooper, et cetera. So I think we – this won't be surprising. We remain interested in M&A. We think there's a lot that we can bring to the table. I continue to believe that there's not a utility in the country that we couldn't run more efficiently and better for customers. And I truly believe that. And so, you know, we continue to look. I think in terms of Sandy Cooper, you know, that process has been pushed to next year. And we remain very interested and continue to be focused on trying to make that happen. Hey, Jim, what regions of the country are you focused on? I'm just curious. We continue to be focused on the Midwest and the Southeast. Gotcha. All right. Thank you very much. Plus FERC-regulated assets pretty much anywhere. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Berg from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Hi. Thanks. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks for taking my question. I had one quick follow-up just on the hydrogen topic. I'm wondering if you see a potential path for this to be an opportunity at NIR? And also in terms of kind of business model, do you think that you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function within the supply chain? And if so, do you have kind of a vision or view on what technology is ahead of others at this point? Thanks, Dave. I would say at this point, we're looking for opportunities across the portfolio. Obviously, we talked about the pilot project, FPL, day, but we are looking at other pilot-type investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio, consistent with the way that we approached solar early on and, of course, batteries more recently. So I think there will be opportunities over time for those type of pilot projects. You know, again, where you think of it as actually being close to economic today are areas where there's already significant penetration of renewables, because as you well know, it's critical to find a low-cost supply in order to make it economic or close to economic. And here in the U.S., you know, the economics certainly have to factor in that today there's a very low cost supply of natural gas, making it, you know, imperative that you find a cheap electricity supply. You know, it's early, you know, never say never on, you know, where we might find opportunities to invest in the business. But historically, as you know, we've not played in the space of owning being a vertically integrated owner of technologies or projects. We've typically taken the best of manufactured equipment from other folks, apply our scale and our ability to construct, own and operate over the long term effectively is where we create value. So, again, it's early, but at this point I wouldn't think that we would focus on vertically integrating. It's more of applying hydrogen as a technology consistent the way that we've created value in the past. So the only thing I would add to that, two things. One is I'd be disappointed if in John's business we don't make some kind of pilot investment in the next year. We're looking at a variety of things, and I'd be disappointed if we don't make some kind of pilot investment in the next year. Very much toe in the water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business. Secondly, you know, clearly we're not going to backward integrate into manufacturing or anything like that. But I wouldn't rule out us owning them as part of an integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacture hydrogen. And as, you know, our view around that would be if we had a long-term contract, and obviously we have access to very efficient capital, we know how to operate equipment, we're, you know, and so a lot of that would, would come to our, I think, our strategic advantages in terms of how we're able to create value for folks. So, you know, I think it's early. There's clearly an opportunity to, you know, five to ten years from now to displace the last 10% of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen. That's clear. I think there's also clearly an opportunity to make renewables to displace diesel fuel and perhaps even other types of transportation fuel going forward. And there's also, I think, clearly an opportunity to make green hydrogen to replace other types of hydrogen and other feedstocks in industrial applications. And so we're looking at all of that, and we're not being – all of that in the end comes back to a very important thing, which is this is going to drive gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts of renewable demand in this country. And so there is no one better positioned than us to take advantage of that, and we're going to be – just like we were on battery storage, we're going to be at the vanguard, This is a big strategic initiative for us, and we're going to drive it, and it's going to be very important for this company, I think, over the next decade. We won't make any money on it in the next five years, just like we didn't make any money in batteries in the first five years, and next year we're deploying a billion dollars of batteries 10 years later. And so that's the way I think about this. decade and in the next decade as well. Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you so much for those comments. I just had one other quick M&A follow-up. I was just wondering if there any path for Texas to be a target of interest for you from an M&A perspective or what would need to change there? Thanks. So we have spent a lot of time in Texas. Obviously, we own assets in Texas. And so we are a great operator. And we feel like we would bring an enormous amount of the state. We own billions of dollars of assets in the state, right? And we're a great, great partner for the state. And so, you know, I would never say never. You know, obviously, we were extraordinarily disappointed in the Encore decision. We think it was a mistake and short-sighted, but, you know, that is what it is. And so it's probably going to take a bit to get past that before I'm super excited about doing things in Texas from an M&A standpoint. Understood. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Michael Lapidus from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Hi. Good morning, everybody. for taking my question. I want to turn to Florida for a second. You're supposed to file rate cases next year at both utilities, and obviously the combination of the two will be a big fast enough. Is there any potential for being able to delay or defer the timing of the rate cases to, A, see what happens from a tax perspective in D.C., from a public policy perspective, just so you don't have to go back to the regulator two or three times over a two- or three-year period? And B, is there any scenario where you may not even need a rate case or rate relief? Good morning, Michael, and we appreciate the question. As I've commented, I think even in these prepared remarks, we do continue to believe that FPL and Gulf would file for a combined rate case in early 2021 for new rates effective in 2022. As you highlighted, there's some uncertainties and certain factors could change, but that's the reality of operating any business. You know what you know those days, and you do the best you can for planning for uncertainties, and we certainly would contemplate changes that we're aware of at the time, but you've got to keep running your business. And what's most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in Florida Power & Light and invest at Gulf Power in these great opportunities that we see for the benefit of our We continue to lead the industry in O&M costs. We continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service. And the best way to keep doing that is execute. And that means occasionally having rate cases. We are excited about that prospect. We've been preparing for it for a long time. And we think we have a great story to tell. And we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we've been doing at FPL and Gulf. So right for now, obviously things are going to be different. could change, but for now, we continue to have those plans to file in 21 for new rates effective 2022. Got it. And one other question, just on the Florida utilities, you have been the industry leader in terms of cost management. Do you think the pace of change in O&M cost declines will stay at this level, meaning the year-over-year change or decline rates, or do you think you're reaching a point where it'll start to flatten out, where the ability to continue to take out as much cost as you've done every year, We'll start just live. The surest answer to that, Michael, is we've got a very creative team, and we've got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that. But let me also not underestimate what that requires, and that requires the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over time. So we have to work for it. And so every year we pull together and come up with our best ideas. period of time that we've exhausted every opportunity? No, in part because I think technology will continue to enhance our ability to do that, but it takes time to execute those opportunities. So our discipline is there, our creativity is there, our innovation, our commitment to continuous improvement, and we're going to do the best we can to create the best value for our customers. Got it. Thank you, Rebecca. Much appreciated."""
